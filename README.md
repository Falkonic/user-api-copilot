## Copilot Usage

I used GitHub Copilot to debug and improve my code during development:

- When writing the `UsersController`, Copilot suggested better ways to handle null-checks and 404 responses.
- Copilot helped me spot missing validation in the `UpdateUser` method.
- It also proposed correct `Http` attributes and method signatures for each CRUD route.
